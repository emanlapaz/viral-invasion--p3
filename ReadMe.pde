 INTRODUCTION:
 
 I developed a game called VIRAL INVASION.
 It is a game wherein you are a RED BLOOD CELL.
 
 Game mechanics:
 There are two modes in the game, a SOLO play mode and the  2 PLAYER duel mode.
 
 In SOLO play (PRESS 1), your goal is to CATCH  all the oxygen in the game screen and try to survive a VIRUS attack.
 
 It has a game timer wherein if the timer goes zero you will be infected and the game is over. 
 
 There is a VACCINE ingame wherein catching one will add 5 seconds on the timer thus extending it. 
 
 Avoid getting hit by the virus as this will decrease your life, and the virus will have a speed boost making it faster. 
 
 If your life is zero, you will be infected.  
 
 Input the number of viruses and vaccines before the setup screen. Default is 10 viruses and 3 vaccines.
 
 In 2 Player Duel mode (PRESS 2), Player 1 controls the Red Cell and Player 2 will control the virus. The goal is to catch the oxygen before the timer runs out. 
 
 White oxygen for the Red cell
 
 Black oxygen for the Virus
 
KEYSTROKES:
 
 Player 1
 W= UP
 A= LEFT
 S= DOWN
 D =RIGHT
 SPACEBAR = CATCH
 
 PLAYER 2
 UP ARROW KEY = UP
 LEFT AROW KEY  = LEFT
 DOWN ARROW KEY= DOWN
 RIGHT ARROW KEY = RIGHT
 “0” (ZERO) IN NUMPAD= CATCH
